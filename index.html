							<h1>The Alexa Prize</h1>
              <p>
                <strong>$2.5 million.</strong> Six months. The chance to join the Alexa Challenge team for Yale.
              </p>
							<p>The goal is to advance several areas of conversational AI including knowledge acquisition, natural language understanding (NLU), natural language generation (NLG), context modeling, commonsense reasoning and dialog planning. Through the innovative work of students, Alexa customers will have novel, engaging conversations.</p>

							<p>So here's the pitch</p>
							<h2>Imagine a Yalie-run cutting-edge research and development organization. Imagine that organization solving the toughest technical challenges in fields from AI to biotech.</h2>

									<h2>Anything is possible</h2>
										<p>
											 By going beyond the competition. We want to transform research by making it better, faster, and more available than ever.
										</p>
										<p>
											We envision at Yale a new kind of research group, built from the ground up to be multi-disciplinary, bold, and open. A place where people can come to make  crazy ideas into projects, where people can find the most unexpected of teammates, and where people can give back by helping others and sharing their results with the community.
										</p>
										<p>
											This project is about developing new ways - changing <strong>how</strong> we build solutions at Yale and beyond.
